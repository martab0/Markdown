<!-- Example of title -->
My exercise in Markdown
=======================

<!-- Here comes the table of content -->

<!-- Example of paragraph of text with line break -->
There must be some kind of way out of here,  
said a joker to the thief. 

There's so much confusion, I just can't get no relief.

<!-- Example of another paragraph -->
Another paragraph here with really long text. Until I break line in some way, Markdown takes this as one paragraph no matter what.

<!-- Example of bold -->
This is **bold** text.  
This is also __bold__ text.

<!-- Example of italic  -->
This is *italic* text.  
This is also _bold_ text.

This ~~not a text~~ that I want to show.

<!-- Example of headers -->

<!-- Example of external link -->

<!-- Example of link to another file -->

<!-- Example of an image -->

<!-- Example of an image with hover text -->

<!-- Example of equation or inline code -->

<!-- Example of a block of code -->

<!-- Example of code highlighting -->

<!-- Example of quote -->

<!-- Example of bullet list -->

<!-- Example of numbered list -->

<!-- Example of table -->

<!-- Paragraph after table -->
